Python 3: The latest 

Steps to Create a Virtual Environment
*****************************************

1. You can create the new directory named 'project-blog' by using 'mkdir' 
command in your Desktop.

2. Change the directory to 'project-blog' by using 'cd' command.

3. The virtual environment is created by using 'python -m venv env', where env is our 
virtual environment

4. For Activating your Virtual Environment:
source webEnv/scripts/activate

5. Installing Django: You can use 'pip install django'

Making a Migrations
***************************

'python manage.py makemigrations' is a first step process which reads the 
'models.py' after it's creation. It creates a new folder called 'migrations' 
where there is a file named '0001_initial.py', which are portable across the 
database.

Migrating to the database
**************************

This is the second step where 'python manage.py migrate' reads the newly 
created folder 'migrations' and creates the database, and it evolves the database 
when there is a change in the model.

Creating SuperUser and Viewing in the Administration panel
***************************************************************
You need to create a SuperUser before accessing the 'admin' panel. 
To do so, use 'winpty python manage.py createsuperuser'.
