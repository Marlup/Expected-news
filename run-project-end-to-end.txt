1. Install library requirements from 'requirements.txt' file

2.1. Open a terminal and change current directory to root/project directory 
     (directory name will be 'GPTNews' if cloned directly from
     github repository).

2.2. To create the databases (django models), run these next two commands in 
     the terminal from the root directory:
     
      python manage.py makemigrations
	
	   python manage.py migrate

3. You are ready to run 'main.py' file from 'source_code' directory

4. Wait ~ 10 - 20 minutes until the process ends. If you re-run 'main.py', it 
   will take less time (~ 1 min)

5. News are loaded in the database, but you have to validate them: open the notebook
   'preprocess_news_test.ipynb' and run all (you can also press 'run-all' button).
   Now the database has news that are ready to be queried by the server, i.e. they can
   be shown on the webpage.

6. Once the previous process finished, you are up to run the server. If django was 
   installed, run this command in the terminal:

	python manage.py runserver

7. Now that the server is running, the webpage can be accessed from your favourite browser in:
	
	https://localhost:8000
