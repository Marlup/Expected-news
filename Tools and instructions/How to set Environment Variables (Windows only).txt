An environment variable is a variable that is set on your operating system, rather than within your application. 
It consists of a name and value.We recommend that you set the name of the variable to OPENAI_API_KEY. 
By keeping this variable name consistent across your team, you can commit and share your code without the risk of exposing your API key.

Set your ‘OPENAI_API_KEY’ Environment Variable via the cmd prompt

Run the following in the cmd prompt, replacing <yourkey> with your API key: 
  
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY “<yourkey>”
  
This will apply to future cmd prompt window, so you will need to open a new one to use that variable with curl. 
You can validate that this variable has been set by opening a new cmd prompt window and typing in 
    
    echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%
