1. Install library requirements from 'requirements.txt' file

2.1. Open a terminal and change the directory to root/project directory 
     (the directory name will be 'GPTNews' if you cloned it directly from the github 
     repository).

2.2. To create the databases (django models), run these two commands in 
     the terminal from the root directory:
     
     	* First *
      
         python manage.py makemigrations
   
      * Second *

     	   2 python manage.py migrate

3. Now you are ready to run the 'main.py' file, which is located in 'source' directory.
   The process (scraping + processes) will take 10 to 20 minutes. Once the program is finished, if you re-run 'main.py', it 
   will take less time to finish (~ 1 min) because most of the data was already scraped and stored in the database.

5. The news data is loaded in a SQLite database, but you have to manually validate it (only in pre-alpha version for testing purposes): open the notebook
   'preprocess_news_test.ipynb' and run all (you can also press 'run-all' button).
   Now the database has news that are ready to be queried by the server, i.e. they can
   be shown on the webpage.

6. Once the previous process finishes, you are up to run the server. If django was 
   installed already, run this command in the terminal:

   	python manage.py runserver

7. Now that the server is running, the webpage can be accessed from your favourite browser at localhost:
	
   	https://localhost:8000
