An environment variable is a variable that you or your applications set in your operating system, rather than within your application. 
It is has a key-value structure. We recommend that you name the env variable to 'OPENAI_API_KEY'. 
By keeping this env variable consistent across your team, you can commit and share your code without the risk of exposing your API key.

* Instructions for Windows OS users *

Let's set your ‘OPENAI_API_KEY’ Environment Variable via the CMD prompt

1) Open CMD prompt.

2) Run the following command, remember replacing <yourkey> with your API key value: 
  
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY “<yourkey>”
  
Now OPENAI_API_KEY variable exists as your environment variable in your system. 
3) You can check the value of the variable by running the 'echo <env_var_name>' command: 

    echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%
